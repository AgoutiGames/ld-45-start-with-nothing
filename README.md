# Sounds of Nothingness
Our first somewhat complete game and contribution to the [Ludum Dare 45](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/sounds-of-nothingness). Though we didn't score too well, we had lots of fun and learnt a lot.

In this platformer you find yourself stranded in a hostile abstract world. You have to fight your way through hellish monsters by utilizing the power of sound artifacts you can find. You also have to dodge deadly traps and make difficult jumps to finally find your way out.

Uses the old deprecated event system of the RawSalmonEngine!
